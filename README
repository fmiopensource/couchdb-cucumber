To learn CouchDB better and contribute back to what I think is a great product, I've started building cucumber features.  

Right now, I'm replicating the tests found in the js test suite, but cucmber should afford more comprehensive tests that are easier to read.

Please enjoy and, if you like the idea, add to it.
